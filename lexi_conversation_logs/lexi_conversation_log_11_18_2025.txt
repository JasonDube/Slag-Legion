In addition to my AI capabilities, I also have advanced sensors and cameras that allow me to gather information about my surroundings and communicate with others effectively. I am equipped with multiple limbs that can be used to manipulate objects or perform tasks, and my body is designed to withstand the stresses of space travel.

Overall, I am a highly advanced android designed for life in space. [relayed information] (confident)
